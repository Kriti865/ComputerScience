Joins are used in Database Management Systems (DBMS) to combine data from multiple tables. They are used to perform multi-table queries. 

**Joins are used when**: 
 * Retrieving data from multiple tables
 * Combining data from various tables
 * Displaying data from small tables as one single entity
 * Combining join product and selection in one single     statement
 * Combining two tables based on a specified common field between them
 * Writing an application that shows employee names and addresses along with their current position, previous positions, and hire date
